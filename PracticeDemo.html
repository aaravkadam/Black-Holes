<h1>Black holes</h1>
<p>A black hole is a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing, including light or other electromagnetic
waves, has enough energy to escape its event horizon.The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact
 mass can deform spacetime to form a black hole.</p>
